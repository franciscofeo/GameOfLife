# John Conway's Game of Life :fire:

Using theory of convolutions we can optimize this script and decrease your compilation time. I'm using [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) to create the matrices and [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) to realize the convolution. Therefore, you need to install these packages in your machine.

*Run this in your command line to install numpy:
> pip install numpy

*And this to install scipy:
> pip install scipy

Now you are ready to enjoy the Game of Life! :zap:
